# Workshop-in-Information-Security
In this semeseter (5th semester) of my B.Sc. Computer Science & Mathematics at Tel Aviv University, I participate in the "Workshop in Information Security".

In this workshop we study the basic design of firewalls, and recreate the basic firewall functionality using just elementary building blocks of the GNU/Linux operating system.
We extend the Linux kernel with packet analysis capabilities, interface it with userspace programs, and experiment with using this firewall for blocking real-world attacks.
This workshop is offered in cooperation with industry experts from Check Point, offering a unique exposure to industry's capabilities and needs, and an opportunity for a real-world impact.

Each directory corresponds to an assignment (out of 5 assignments) which was given as part of the workshop.
In each directory you may find guidelines (i.e. descripition of each assignment), and my solution for it (code & documantation).
This workshop is ongoing and the git is keep updating.
